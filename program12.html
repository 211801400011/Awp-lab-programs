       The swanky new Buggati La Voiture Noire comes with radical wheels, the fascia is bespoke, and the badge at the backlights up to spell the name of the brand, making it evidently Buggati.
        La Voiture Noire is a tribute to the history of the legendary Buggati.
         It stands for sophistication and elegance. It brings speed, aesthetics, luxury, and technology and is nothing short of an icon.
